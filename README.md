# Unity_2D_Introduction
Introduction to making a 2D platforming game in Unity

First you'll want to clone or download this repository and load it into Unity.

You do this by opening your version of Unity and while on the `Projects` page, clicking `OPEN` and finding the filepath where you saved the project and navigating and selecting the `2D_Intro` folder.

This project was built in Unity 5.5.0f3 and if your Unity version does not match, you'll get a little warning. Click `Continue` to allow Unity to import the project anyways. 

When it loads, you'll be looking at notice that there is a `Completed` folder where you can reference the completed scene, scripts, sprites and animations if you ever need to. 

You should also see `Animations`, `Scenes`, `Scripts`, and `Sprites` folders. This is where we'll add our files while we're working on this project.
